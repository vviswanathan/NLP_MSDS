      "films that revolve around characters repeating the same day over and over again has grown very tired in my mind groundhog day perfected it and it really wasn t until more recently with edge of tomorrow that i really found a film that seemed to stand out among the rest well i m glad that i can now add palm springs to the list of films to put a clever spin on this concept this film was originally supposed to play at more film festivals around the world and eventually receive a theatrical release but things being the way they are hulu has now released it although this may be a film that s hard to find for some right now here s why palm springs is one of the very best movies to come out of this bare year of so far nyles andy samberg and sarah cristin milioti find themselves sort of bonding over the fact that they both really don t want to be at the wedding they re at he s the date of someone who cheats on him and she is the sister of the bride who clearly has many issues stumbling across a strange cave after the wedding they both find themselves caught in a time loop that has them reliving the same day over and over again certain things are revealed about each of these characters that add a lot more depth to the story and i found myself incredibly engaged from beginning to end where this film shines the most is in the fact that it completely commits to the whole time loop concept even giving a few winks at the audience it never once makes any huge mistakes logically which felt refreshing especially in the ways it would subvert expectations and most importantly in the way that they choose to conclude the story the way palm springs wraps up was a very entertaining and emotionally earned finale now i feel like i say this about a lot of movies that focus so much of their time on very few characters but i truly mean that if samberg and milioti didn t have any fun chemistry together this film would ve been a disaster this is probably the most laid back and comfortable i ve ever seen andy samberg be in a film and it made the entire experience that much better only having written and directed a few short films and a documentary before tackling palm springs director max barbakow has honestly blown me away here with a small budget a small number of characters and a small scope this film felt much bigger than it was i can honestly see a big future for him in the coming years i will gladly seek out his next project on top of his stellar work on this film writer andy siara who also doesn t have a huge filmography as of yet added a very funny and clever tone to the whole concept it was clear that the performers were very comfortable with the dialogue because their acting lept off the screen and that just seemed to be a nice mixture of everything coming together nicely behind the scenes in the end palm springs is a film that i was very much looking forward to but was wary of due to the concept itself thankfully this is one of the best movies that i ve seen accomplish this concept in years i m not calling it a masterpiece by any means but for a fun time loop movie i really couldn t find many issues at a mere minutes this movie flies by and has just enough clever surprises for those who may not have been completely engaged while the idea itself has grown tired for me this movie is undeniably hard to dislike everything about this movie put a huge smile on my face and if that isn t what the world needs right now i don t know what is\n",

For a character that is supposed to be the ideal \"good\" she is certainly not and Rian Johnson does not understand what \"good\" is. An entirely \"good\" character would have to do good to be considered even close to being good. Marta does nothing of the sort. She plays the game Harlan\\'s way (no matter what Blanc says), she tries to do everything the way Harlan wants even though she knows what she is doing is wrong and that is not the doings of a \"good person.\" Her character is supposed to be an angel who is the only truthful person around, who can\\'t even lie without puking. But, she does lie and hide her puking. She also actively, willingly hides the truth till the end. If she were a perfectly good character, then she would not have hidden the truth, going to great lengths.The writer does not understand that there is no difference between actively hiding the truth and lying. Marta is a selfish person who looks for her or her family\\'s benefit. If there is self-interest, there can be no \"good.\" If there is \"good,\" there can be no self-interest. There is no difference between the Thrombey\\'s looking out for their own and Marta looking out for her own. If one should be considered \"bad\" than the other is as well. And this is the case. This is why screenwriters should seek help from advisors of ethics when they try to write stories that make judgements about such subjects.'"
