I felt like I want to punch screen of my laptop every 5 minutes.I honestly don't even know where to start... Everything about the movies is ridiculous. First of all the plot- so flat, predictable and banal that you just want it to finish before it stars. In a bad way. Not like The end of the world ridiculous, funny and silly way. It's like a copy of every simple comedy with decent characters combined into not funny, boring, bad shot and bad acted movie. No chemistry between actors whatsoever- the only character carrying the weight of decency is Sean- probably the only positive aspect of this movie. Dialogue horrible- sounds like written by acting students on a Sunday night for a Monday assignment. Honestly. I'm not even mean. Do not hope for a single lough- it's not gonna happen. Bad plot, no chemistry, flat, boring and too long. I feel like this movie sucked piece of my soul away and threw to a sewer.\",\n",

I was trying to think of situations in which the writers would have been in too much of a hurry to come up with a better story, but nothing came to mind. Even a kid writing a book report on the bus to school on the morning it is due could come up with a better product. Even if the writers had only been allotted the amount of time of the trailer to write the entire script, they should have done better, even if they were all morbidly hung over.It\\'s the old \"unsend an email\" plot that has been done a million times. Spoiler Alert: it was stupid the first time they did it, so imagine the same premise now. Yeah, neither can I.If you get down to the absolute bottom of the barrel in movie ideas, you\\'d still need to dig another couple of miles to reach the place where they discovered this script.
