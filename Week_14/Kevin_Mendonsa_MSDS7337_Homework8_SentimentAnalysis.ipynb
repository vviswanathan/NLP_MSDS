    "Perform a vocabulary-based sentiment analysis of the movie reviews you used in homework 5 and homework 7, by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIn Python, load one of the sentiment vocabularies referenced in the textbook, and run the sentiment analyzer as explained in the corresponding reference. Add words to the sentiment vocabulary, if you think you need to, to better fit your particular text collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tFor each of the clusters you created in homework 7, compute the average, median, high, and low sentiment scores for each cluster. Explain whether you think this reveals anything interesting about the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tFor extra credit, analyze sentiment of chunks as follows:\n",
    "a.\tTake the chunks from homework 5, and in Python, run each chunk individually through your sentiment analyzer that you used in question 1. If the chunk registers a nonneutral sentiment, save it in a tabular format (the chunk, the sentiment score).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\tNow sort the table twice, once to show the highest negative-sentiment-scoring chunks at the top and again to show the highest positive-sentiment-scoring chunks at the top. Examine the upper portions of both sorted lists, to identify any trends, and explain what you see. \n",

    "\"For example- Words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is intelligent enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY”\"\n",

      "i wasn t going to write my thoughts after i saw this film as i usually don t bother to do that but now it has been a couple of days and this movie has been eating at me for a little bit so i felt i had to say what needed to be said listen there is so much woke talk going around these days woke is the new pc political correctness and i do not immediately draw conclusions just because a movie has a female leading role some of the best movies i have ever seen has leading females for example alien aliens terminator and kill bill and i also really liked mad max fury road in which charlize was the leading role and made hardy look like a movie extra i love great movies with a great story with a great script great direction great acting great cinematography great music great cgi i love movies that can deliver greatness this is why my top ten movies and tv series of all time is angry men schindler s list pulp fiction the shawshank redemption alien das boot apocalypse now band of brothers breaking bad and the wire i have seen over movies in my life and i have even worked as a movie critic but of course my opinion is just subjective like anyone else s i m just mentioning this because i do have some experience with this anyways to try and keep all my points short this movie has lots of bad acting in it which is quite shocking when you look at some of the cast the villain is dull and the story is a mess and on the flip side we have a carefully balanced cast of white black middle eastern and asian actors and also two male characters that just happens to be gay listen i have seen brokeback mountain it s a really good film i grew up watching jackie chan and bruce lee movies which i love to this day i am not homophobe or a racist or a sexist all i want is great movies what defines a great movie well that is of course up to anyone to find out for themselves but when a movie is so obviously designed around political correctness the movie as a whole will suffer why because when your goal is to include as much lgbqt as possible the story itself comes second and if the movie isn t founded in cement everything else will fall apart what i think is weird is how high this movie is rated it is only points behind terminator just no it is point ahead of kill bill no this movie is not even in spitting distance of those two films yet still critics seem to love it this is evidence of woke i am so sorry but it is there is just no other way of describing it i have seen this movie i went in with an open heart as always and i m just left with this empty feeling inside of what did i just watch bad directing bad acting bad script forced lgbqt story absolutely horribly bad villain i shake my head in disbelief and it is higher rated than kill bill ok then and another example it s also higher rated than se en and joker yeah no nope nope nope i don t care about subjectivity anymore we are living in a world now where certain forces are at play messing up peoples brain what this movie has is some cool action scenes but even those become dull before we reach the half way mark just an endless slaughter of stunt men in black armor gear can it be more dull no it can t in kill bill at least we had quentin tarantino at the helm who carefully crafted each scene and made action scenes that are among some of the best ever filmed but gina prince bythewood is no quentin tarantino to put it mildly the action is generic predictable and dull so this movie doesn t work as an action movie either and this sort of deep story they try to weave through the entire thing about charlize s loss and how she has suffered and what she has been through it doesn t work they failed and it is actually because their focus is in the wrong place this movie is bad stay way\n",

      "that an action film should be exciting seems axiomatic so trite as to hardly bear mentioning however the old guard is more often an exercise in tedium interrupted by mindless action scenes we ve seen done before and better the plot is a mash up of elements from highlander and coronet blue a television series from the s with a dash of shared dreams from inception however as with many current films the filmmakers seem more interested in exploring social issues than character and plot development much of the screen time is devoted to the dramatic question of whether a black female can be a superhero of course this can t be somebody who is just black enough to seem exotically ethnic with the manners sophistication education and polish of an upper middleclass suburbanite but a tough streetwise dark complexioned cornrow coifed war veteran who s a bit rough around the edges so much time and attention is devoted to the training and inculcation of this new recruit that potentially more interesting elements in the script are given short shrift one character has an existential dilemma which is never resolved an intriguing element concerning the fate of a former member of the team is never resolved despite the team s paranormal ability to share dreams but is inexplicably revisited in a postscript scene during the credits there is no b story to give the movie emotional depth the only romance is a homosexual relationship between two of the team members which may offend some but will leave most viewers disinterested there are several pitched gunfights with evil minions dressed in full tactical gear with helmets and balaclavas who are dispatched with surfeit of bullets but minimal bloodshed and about as much emotional impact as decommissioning robots charlize theron was quoted recently criticizing steven seagal s fight sequences and suggesting that her own were more realistic and intense for action film fans one criterion for evaluating action scenes is the length of the shots in jcvd jean claude van damme does a three minute scene involving numerous weapons and opponents shot in one take that s impressive tog employs a lot of quick cuts which only require the performers to master one move the fights are fairly good but pale compared to movies like the raid and banlieue district b or the films of tony jaa jackie chan and jason stratham the filmmakers seem so concerned with being woke that they neglect to make the film exciting rewarding intriguing or cathartic\n",

      "firstly i want to discuss dbs and my theory to what could of possibly happened here dbs was a movie that was never asked for and we got it the production company behind dbs was indeed syfy with warner which explains the mess it was syfy has a long history of making a mess of once monster blockbuster movies lake placid anaconda etc i m not sure what the intentions were around syfy taking over dbs from warner however the possibly that they could make a cheap movie that had a fan base and not do very much and make money is what comes to mind researching the production background of dbs syfy had no involvement with this movie and it clearly shows in the finished product however my theory is that dbs made a lot of money in dvd sales and had the hype for warner to want to the take back the rights or warner were genuinely disappointed with the results of dbs and did not want them to continue making a bad name for dbs with high number sales this reflects on all the recent syfy movies dvd sales where majority of their movies struggle to hit k in sales which is the possible factor to warner taking the rights back for dbs and making a better movie now to the movie itself i m not going to sit here and tell you this is the best movie this year and it was amazing but there was a huge improvement in every department and x better then dbs the movie was actually entertaining and the story floated away from the previous movie setting and introduced to a more realistic setting the acting was better however in parts were badly presented however i went into this movie knowing it was no meg with leading name actors staring the cgi could be considered awful and yes it was for current technology but again they re not going to throw a m budget into a movie that was never going to make it near and reviewers and viewers need to consider this when watching some scenes that were really a huge improvement were the likes of a boat sinking death scenes and the explosions dbs would never however the shark cgi is the one issue that ruins aspects of the movie you get a good scene with a badly cgi shark my suggestion would of been to create a animated real shark this would of been cheaper then cgi for scenes from behind or for example a scene where a shark had been captured and held would of suited better with a realistic image again this takes time and a on going amount of money this would of definitely helped with the end scene where the main character emma is being attacked underwater inside a structure machine and you see various shots of the shark from above and the tail waving around the story was interesting i liked the aspect that they moved away from the research facility however it still linked as those sharks have escaped and a science team had came to capture them the plot centres around a environmental team vs science team which equals to a battle for cruelty and research which and who is right and it links the previous movies although as much as we want to forget dbs how the movie was set up previously we had to have some background aspect of the previous movie for the franchise to continue however if you go into movie not watching dbs you can just imagine the same scenario from the first movie with small elements not from the first movie however they explain them in this for the viewer to understand and they are easy to pick up and this is the conclusion of the movie overall dbs is actually a really fun entertaining movie and doesn t deserve some of the harsh reviews it is getting from viewers do not go into this movie expecting a meg styled movie with a huge budget with amazing scenes and stars leading it s definitely one of those movies you watch when there is nothing else to watch however if you were browsing through the tv and you saw it on you would probably watch again to be entertained and to get rid of boredom i am giving this movie based on the fact that certain scenes were badly paced and acted and they could of used real elements for the sharks as this is a shark movie and not a action movie and if warner were taking over the project because of how negative dbs was perceived i would like to think they would of thought about this more which makes me believe that this movie was made to make more money this is from warner a company worth billion they have the contacts and partnerships to make a cheap movie look better\n",

      "with the exception of my wife and daughter and possibly my mother agatha christie is the woman whom i love most on this planet she truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays more than forty years after she passed away there are still many adaptations of her original work but with knives out writer director rian johnson attempts something entirely different it s abundantly clear that johnson was inspired by all of christie s typical trademarks and hobby horses and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings but the plot of knives out is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen a good old fashioned murder mystery whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets convoluted plot twists continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along and a fabulous all knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues daniel craig is downright terrific as benoit blanc a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one liners hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch harlan thrombey it looks like suicide but literally every greedy member of harlan s bloodline had a motive for killing and also in delightful agatha christie tradition the plot even thickens after the reading of the will it would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive compelling as well as humorous complex but simultaneously light headed and entertaining the cast is phenomenal craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his james bond character and the thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents including jamie lee curtis michael shannon toni colette christopher plummer and don johnson knives out is perhaps slightly too long but never tedious and very well directed by rian johnson who honestly doesn t deserve all this hatred from disappointed star wars geeks\n",

      "have to say i was a little disappointed by this not because it isn t good arguably it is but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good which it isn t so as with so many films your experience enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you overall i think nearly everyone will enjoy this particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated cgi having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of hollywood one of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath but not always beneath the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it s difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie which without giving too much away it ultimately does what is genuinely enjoyable is daniel craig s slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match the rest of the cast features some big names but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don t always have that much to do jamie lee curtis and toni collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is don johnson the plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all and while it s quite good it isn t that good or that original the key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable for the record i didn t work out who did it but did work out the mechanism involved if one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement knives out falls somewhat short a part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn t clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place in the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister perhaps the best aspect of the film aside of daniel craig was the fact that the johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller i ll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though i d have to say i probably enjoyed adam sandler jennifer aniston s murder mystery more than this including with regard to the solution knives out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it or anyone else i d venture thinks it is still enjoyable though\n",

    "- It is evident that the clusters have movies of mixed ratings and sentiment scores.  This is probably because we used arbitrary mappings for this exercise.  As indicated in homework 7, there could be some possible overlap between clusters as the means appear to be very close to each other.  A more scientific approach to assigning the sentiment to the reviewer ratings and the assignment of the predicted sentiment scores to the \"negative\" and \"positive\" classes may have resulted in a better clustering.  However, the intent of the assignment is to understand how a sentiment analyzer works when applied to reviews and clustering helps further reinforce that concept."
