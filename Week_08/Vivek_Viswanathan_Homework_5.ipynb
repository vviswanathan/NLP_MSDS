    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I started by extracting the user reviews from the IMDB website. I chose \"Romance\" as the genre for this assignment. I did not have any specific reason to choose this genre but I tested the program with other Genres like Action, Adventure, Comedy, and Thriller as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the reviews were extracted, we proceed to identify Noun Phrases by chunking the reviews. A total of 101 reviews were extracted (Top 5 Romance movies) and used as part of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "After glancing through the initial results, it was observed that proper nouns were not being tagged as Noun Phrases. This behaviour was changed using a simple tweak to the grammar pattern. Instead of looking for nouns (NN), the pattern was altered to look for <NN.\\*>. This would include Proper Noun (NNP), plural form of noun (NNS) and proper noun (NNPS) as well in addition to regular nouns(NN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern was also tweaked to include <JJ.\\*> to include comparitive and superlative adjectives. This helped us tag \"the worst movie\" as a noun phrase."
